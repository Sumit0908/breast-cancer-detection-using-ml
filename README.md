# Breast Cancer Detection using Machine Learning

This project implements **Breast Cancer Detection** using various **Machine Learning algorithms** with a simple app interface for prediction.  
It is based on the **Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset (WBCD)** and demonstrates how ML can assist in early detection of breast cancer.

## 📌 Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Model training using ML algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, etc.)  
- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score  
- Deployment-ready application (using Flask/Streamlit) for predictions

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sumit0908/breast-cancer-detection-using-ml.git
   cd breast-cancer-detection-using-ml


Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Run the app:

python app.py


or (if using Streamlit)

streamlit run app.py

📊 Dataset

Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository – Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset

Attributes: 30 features (mean, se, worst values of cell nuclei), Target: Malignant / Benign

🚀 Results

Achieved high accuracy (90%+) across multiple models.

Random Forest & SVM performed the best on test data.

Interactive prediction app for real-time diagnosis support.

📌 Future Improvements

Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV / RandomizedSearchCV

Deployment to cloud (Heroku, AWS, or Streamlit Sharing)

Integration with medical image datasets (deep learning models)
